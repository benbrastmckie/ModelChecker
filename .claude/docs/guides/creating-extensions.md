# Creating Extensions Guide

[Back to Docs](../README.md) | [Extension System](../architecture/extension-system.md) | [Adding Domains](adding-domains.md)

Step-by-step guide for creating a new domain extension for the .claude/ system.

---

## Overview

Extensions are self-contained packages that add domain-specific support (agents, skills, rules, context) to the .claude/ system. Extensions can be loaded/unloaded via the extension picker without modifying core files. Extensions can optionally declare dependencies on other extensions for shared resources.

**When to Create an Extension**:
- Adding support for a new language/framework (Rust, React, Go)
- Adding support for a specialized tool (Lean, Z3, Typst)
- Creating portable domain knowledge that can be shared across projects

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Create Extension Directory

```bash
mkdir -p .claude/extensions/your-domain/{agents,skills,rules,context/project/your-domain}
```

### 2. Create Required Files

```bash
# Required files
touch .claude/extensions/your-domain/manifest.json
touch .claude/extensions/your-domain/EXTENSION.md
touch .claude/extensions/your-domain/README.md

# Optional but recommended
touch .claude/extensions/your-domain/index-entries.json
```

### 3. Populate Files

Follow the templates below for each file type.

---

## File Templates

### manifest.json (Required)

```json
{
  "name": "your-domain",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Your domain description for picker display",
  "task_type": "your-domain",
  "dependencies": [],
  "provides": {
    "agents": [
      "your-domain-research-agent.md",
      "your-domain-implementation-agent.md"
    ],
    "skills": [
      "skill-your-domain-research",
      "skill-your-domain-implementation"
    ],
    "commands": [],
    "rules": [
      "your-domain.md"
    ],
    "context": [
      "project/your-domain"
    ],
    "scripts": [],
    "hooks": [],
    "docs": [],
    "templates": [],
    "systemd": [],
    "root_files": [],
    "data": []
  },
  "routing": {
    "research": {
      "your-domain": "skill-your-domain-research"
    },
    "implement": {
      "your-domain": "skill-your-domain-implement"
    }
  },
  "merge_targets": {
    "claudemd": {
      "source": "EXTENSION.md",
      "target": ".claude/CLAUDE.md",
      "section_id": "extension_your_domain"
    },
    "index": {
      "source": "index-entries.json",
      "target": ".claude/context/index.json"
    }
  },
  "mcp_servers": {}
}
```

**Field Reference**:

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | Yes | Extension name (matches directory name) |
| `version` | Yes | Semantic version for update tracking |
| `description` | Yes | Shown in picker UI |
| `task_type` | No | Language code for orchestrator routing (omit for resource-only extensions) |
| `dependencies` | No | Extensions that must load first (auto-loaded silently) |
| `provides` | Yes | Lists all files/directories provided |
| `merge_targets` | Yes | Defines CLAUDE.md and index.json merging |
| `mcp_servers` | No | MCP server configs to merge |

For the complete manifest schema with all field descriptions and examples, see [Extension System Architecture](../architecture/extension-system.md#manifest-schema).

### EXTENSION.md (Required)

Content included in CLAUDE.md via `generate_claudemd()` when loaded:

```markdown
## Your Domain Extension

This project includes [Your Domain] support via the your-domain extension.

### Language Routing

| Task Type | Research Tools | Implementation Tools |
|----------|----------------|---------------------|
| `your-domain` | WebSearch, WebFetch, Read | Read, Write, Edit, Bash (your-tool) |

### Skill-Agent Mapping

| Skill | Agent | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| skill-your-domain-research | your-domain-research-agent | [Your Domain] research |
| skill-your-domain-implementation | your-domain-implementation-agent | [Your Domain] implementation |

### Quick Reference

- Feature 1: Description or keymap
- Feature 2: Description or keymap
- Common pattern: Example usage
```

### README.md (Required)

Every extension must provide a `README.md` file in its root directory. This is the user-facing overview of the extension, distinct from `EXTENSION.md` (which is included in `.claude/CLAUDE.md` via `generate_claudemd()` when the extension is loaded).

Start from the canonical template: `.claude/templates/extension-readme-template.md`.

The template includes a **section-applicability matrix** that distinguishes simple extensions (latex, python, typst, z3) from complex extensions (filetypes, lean, formal, nix, web, epidemiology). Simple extensions omit sections they do not need (MCP Setup, Workflow diagram, Output Artifacts) and produce README files under ~120 lines. Complex extensions use the full structure.

**Required sections for all extensions**:
- Overview (with a task type / command table)
- Installation
- Skill-Agent Mapping
- Language Routing
- References (optional but encouraged)

**Required sections for complex extensions**:
- MCP Tool Setup (if the extension configures MCP servers)
- Commands (if the extension provides commands)
- Architecture tree
- Workflow diagram
- Output Artifacts
- Key Patterns
- Tool Dependencies

The doc-lint script at `.claude/scripts/check-extension-docs.sh` flags missing `README.md` files during verification.

### index-entries.json (Recommended)

Context file metadata for agent discovery:

```json
{
  "entries": [
    {
      "path": "context/project/your-domain/README.md",
      "description": "Overview of your domain context",
      "tags": ["your-domain", "overview"],
      "load_when": {
        "task_types": ["your-domain"],
        "agents": ["your-domain-research-agent", "your-domain-implementation-agent"]
      }
    },
    {
      "path": "context/project/your-domain/patterns/common-pattern.md",
      "description": "Common implementation patterns",
      "tags": ["your-domain", "patterns"],
      "load_when": {
        "task_types": ["your-domain"],
        "agents": ["your-domain-implementation-agent"]
      }
    },
    {
      "path": "context/project/your-domain/standards/style-guide.md",
      "description": "Coding style conventions",
      "tags": ["your-domain", "style"],
      "load_when": {
        "task_types": ["your-domain"],
        "agents": ["your-domain-implementation-agent"]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

---

## Resource-Only Extensions

Extensions that provide only shared context (no agents, skills, commands, or routing) are called resource-only extensions. They exist to share resources between other extensions.

**Example**: The `slidev` extension provides Slidev animation patterns and CSS style presets consumed by `founder` and `present`:

```json
{
  "name": "slidev",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Shared Slidev animation patterns and CSS style presets",
  "dependencies": [],
  "provides": {
    "agents": [], "skills": [], "commands": [],
    "rules": [], "context": ["project/slidev"],
    "scripts": [], "hooks": []
  },
  "merge_targets": {
    "index": { "source": "index-entries.json", "target": ".claude/context/index.json" }
  }
}
```

Consuming extensions declare the dependency: `"dependencies": ["slidev"]`. When founder or present is loaded, slidev is auto-loaded first if not already present.

**Key characteristics**:
- No `task_type` field (no routing)
- No `EXTENSION.md` or `claudemd` merge target (nothing included in CLAUDE.md)
- Only `provides.context` populated
- Loaded automatically as a dependency, not typically selected directly

For complete resource-only extension patterns, see [Extension System Architecture](../architecture/extension-system.md).

# Your Domain Context

Domain knowledge for [Your Domain] development.

## Directory Structure

- domain/ - Core concepts and terminology
- patterns/ - Common implementation patterns
- standards/ - Coding conventions and style guide
- tools/ - Tool-specific guides

## Loading Strategy

**Always load** README.md first for overview.

| Task Type | Load These Files |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Research | domain/overview.md |
| Implementation | standards/style-guide.md, patterns/*.md |
| Setup | domain/overview.md, tools/tool-guide.md |

## Agent Context Loading

| Agent | Primary Context |
|-------|----------------|
| your-domain-research-agent | domain/*, tools/* |
| your-domain-implementation-agent | standards/*, patterns/* |
```

---

## Testing Your Extension

### 1. Load the Extension

Press the extension picker and select your extension from the picker.

### 2. Verify Files are Installed

```bash
# Check agents
ls .claude/agents/your-domain-*-agent.md

# Check skills
ls .claude/skills/skill-your-domain-*/SKILL.md

# Check rules
ls .claude/rules/your-domain.md

# Check context
ls .claude/context/project/your-domain/

# Check CLAUDE.md content was included
grep "Your Domain Extension" .claude/CLAUDE.md

# Check index entries
grep "your-domain" .claude/context/index.json
```

### 3. Test Routing

Create a test task:
```
/task "Test your-domain feature" --language your-domain
```

Run research:
```
/research {task_number}
```

Verify:
- Orchestrator routes to `skill-your-domain-research`
- Research agent loads correct context
- Report is created successfully

### 4. Test Unload

Press the extension picker and select your extension again to unload.

Verify:
- All copied files are removed
- CLAUDE.md section is removed
- Index entries are removed

---

## Lifecycle Hooks

Extensions can declare **lifecycle hook scripts** in `manifest.json` under a top-level `hooks` object. These hooks are invoked by `skill-base.sh` at specific points in the skill execution lifecycle, before and after agent delegation.

### Hooks vs. provides.hooks

**Important distinction**: Two different `hooks` concepts exist in manifests:

| Field | Purpose | Example |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `"hooks": {}` (top-level) | Lifecycle hook scripts called by skill-base.sh | `{"preflight": "scripts/my-check.sh"}` |
| `"provides": { "hooks": [] }` | File-copy targets deployed to `.claude/hooks/` | `["log-session.sh", "post-command.sh"]` |

Top-level `hooks` are NOT copied anywhere — they are called in-place from the extension directory.

### Hook Schema

Add a `hooks` object to your manifest:

```json
{
  "name": "your-domain",
  ...
  "hooks": {
    "preflight": "scripts/your-domain-preflight.sh",
    "context_injection": "scripts/your-domain-context.sh",
    "verification": "scripts/your-domain-verify.sh",
    "postflight": "scripts/your-domain-postflight.sh"
  }
}
```

All hooks are optional. Missing keys (or `"hooks": {}`) are silently skipped.

### Hook Execution Contract

Hook scripts receive 5 positional arguments:

| Arg | Variable | Example |
|-----|----------|---------|
| `$1` | `task_number` | `42` |
| `$2` | `task_type` | `"your-domain"` |
| `$3` | `task_dir` | `"specs/042_my-task"` |
| `$4` | `session_id` | `"sess_1234_abc"` |
| `$5` | `operation` | `"research"` or `"implement"` |

**Exit codes**:
- Exit 0: success (hook output printed to stdout)
- Exit non-zero: warning logged (non-blocking, skill continues)

Scripts MUST be executable (`chmod +x`).

### Lifecycle Stage Mapping

| Hook | Called From | When |
|------|-------------|------|
| `preflight` | `skill_preflight_update()` | After status is set to "in_progress" |
| `context_injection` | `skill_context_injection()` | Before agent delegation |
| `verification` | `skill_validate_artifact()` | After agent returns, artifact validated |
| `postflight` | `skill_postflight_update()` | After status is set to completed |

### Example: Preflight Validation Hook

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# scripts/your-domain-preflight.sh

set -euo pipefail

TASK_NUMBER="${1:-}"
TASK_TYPE="${2:-}"
TASK_DIR="${3:-}"
SESSION_ID="${4:-}"
OPERATION="${5:-}"

# Validate toolchain availability (warn but do not fail)
if ! command -v your-tool &>/dev/null; then
  echo "[your-domain-preflight] WARNING: 'your-tool' not found" >&2
fi

echo "[your-domain-preflight] Preflight OK"
exit 0
```

### Example: Context Injection Hook

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# scripts/your-domain-context.sh

set -euo pipefail

TASK_NUMBER="${1:-}"
TASK_TYPE="${2:-}"
TASK_DIR="${3:-}"
SESSION_ID="${4:-}"
OPERATION="${5:-}"

echo "[your-domain-context] Domain context:"

if command -v your-tool &>/dev/null; then
  version=$(your-tool --version 2>/dev/null | head -1 || echo "unknown")
  echo "[your-domain-context]   Tool version: $version"
fi

exit 0
```

### Adding Hooks to Your Extension

1. Create `scripts/` directory in your extension:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p .claude/extensions/your-domain/scripts
   ```

2. Create and make executable:
   ```bash
   touch .claude/extensions/your-domain/scripts/your-domain-preflight.sh
   chmod +x .claude/extensions/your-domain/scripts/your-domain-preflight.sh
   ```

3. Update `manifest.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "hooks": {
       "preflight": "scripts/your-domain-preflight.sh"
     }
   }
   ```

4. Verify with jq:
   ```bash
   jq '.hooks' .claude/extensions/your-domain/manifest.json
   ```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Extension Not Appearing in Picker

1. Check manifest.json exists and is valid JSON:
   ```bash
   cat .claude/extensions/your-domain/manifest.json | jq .
   ```

2. Verify extension directory is in the correct location:
   ```bash
   ls .claude/extensions/your-domain/
   ```

### Load Fails with Conflicts

The loader detected existing files that would be overwritten and showed a confirmation dialog. If you chose not to override, the load was cancelled. To resolve:
- Rename conflicting files in your extension to avoid the collision
- Remove conflicting files from core (if safe)
- Check if another extension provides the same files
- Re-run the load and confirm the override if the conflict is acceptable

### Routing Not Working After Load

1. Check CLAUDE.md includes your extension content:
   ```bash
   grep "Your Domain Extension" .claude/CLAUDE.md
   ```

2. Verify orchestrator knows about your language routing (check `task_type` in manifest and routing entries)

3. Check skill files exist:
   ```bash
   ls .claude/skills/skill-your-domain-*/SKILL.md
   ```

### Context Not Loading

1. Verify index entries were added:
   ```bash
   jq '.entries[] | select(.path | contains("your-domain"))' .claude/context/index.json
   ```

2. Check agent references correct context paths
