## High Priority

### 1. Create .claude/ directory copy instructions for Claude Code users
- **Effort**: 2-3 hours
- **Status**: [NOT STARTED]
- **Priority**: High
- **Language**: general
- **Blocking**: None
- **Dependencies**: None

**Description**: Create a document in .claude/docs/guides/ that explains how to clone and copy the .claude/ directory from the ModelChecker repository (providing the full GitHub URL) into the root directory from which a Claude Code instance is running. Then include an instruction step in /home/benjamin/Projects/ModelChecker/.claude/docs/guides/user-installation.md which directs the user to pass the URL to this document to Claude Code to follow those instructions to copy .claude/ into the directory. Then direct the user to restart Claude Code and test the commands, providing a link to /home/benjamin/Projects/ModelChecker/.claude/docs/commands/README.md for further information. URLs in user-installation.md intended for pasting into Claude Code must be full URLs (not relative paths).

**Files Affected**:
- .claude/docs/guides/copy-claude-directory.md (new)
- .claude/docs/guides/user-installation.md (update)
