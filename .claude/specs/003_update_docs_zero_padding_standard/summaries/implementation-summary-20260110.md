# Implementation Summary: Task #3

**Completed**: 2026-01-10
**Duration**: ~10 minutes

## Changes Made

Updated CLAUDE.md to reflect the 3-digit zero-padded directory naming convention for task artifacts. Added a one-line note referencing state-management.md for format details.

## Files Modified

- `.claude/CLAUDE.md` - Changed `{NUMBER}_{SLUG}` to `{NNN}_{SLUG}` in Task Artifact Paths section, added cross-reference note

## Verification

- [x] No `{NUMBER}_` patterns remain in CLAUDE.md
- [x] Task Artifact Paths section shows `{NNN}_{SLUG}` format
- [x] Brief cross-reference to state-management.md included
- [x] No verbose or redundant documentation added

## Notes

- Workflow descriptions still use `{N}_{SLUG}` shorthand (intentional - these describe procedures, not format)
- The authoritative format documentation remains in state-management.md "Project Number Format" section
