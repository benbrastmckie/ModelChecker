# Implementation Summary: Task 318 - Phase 2 Complete

Implemented formula complexity metrics in `Logos/Core/Syntax/Formula.lean`: `modalDepth`, `temporalDepth`, and `countImplications`. Added 30+ unit tests in `LogosTest/Core/Syntax/FormulaTest.lean` covering all metrics and edge cases. All tests pass, compilation successful. Next: Phase 3 (Domain-Specific Heuristics).
