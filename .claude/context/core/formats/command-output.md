# Command Output Standard

## Overview

This standard defines the format for command output displayed to users by the orchestrator. It ensures consistent, clear, and concise output across all commands.

## Purpose

- Provide clear context about which task or command is running
- Maintain brief, informative summaries (<100 tokens)
- Ensure consistent output format across all commands
- Avoid redundant information in output

## Header Format

### Task Number Format

Use `Task #{N}` format consistently (no colon after the number):
- Correct: `Task #258`
- Incorrect: `Task #258:` or `Task: 258`

### Task-Based Commands

Commands that operate on specific tasks display:

```
{Action} for Task #{N}

{Brief 1-2 sentence summary}

{Artifact label}: {path}

Status: [{STATUS}]
Next: /{command} {N}
```

### Direct Commands

Commands that operate without task context display:

```
{Action} Complete

{Brief 1-2 sentence summary}

{Metrics or counts (if applicable)}

Next Steps:
1. {step}
```

## Output Templates

Commands are assigned to one of three templates based on output complexity.

### Template A: Simple (4-6 lines)

For commands with single artifact and straightforward outcome.

**Structure:**
```
{Action} for Task #{N}

{Artifact}: {path}

Status: [{STATUS}]
Next: /{command} {N}
```

**Example:**
```
Research completed for Task #258

Report: specs/258_modal_logic/reports/01_modal-logic-research.md

Status: [RESEARCHED]
Next: /plan 258
```

**Assigned Commands:** `/research`, `/plan`, `/task`

### Template B: Standard (8-12 lines)

For commands with multiple artifacts or metrics.

**Structure:**
```
{Action} for Task #{N}

{Primary artifact}: {path}

{Metric or count section}:
- {item}: {value}

Status: [{STATUS}]
Next: /{command} {N}
```

**Example:**
```
Implementation complete for Task #258

Summary: specs/258_modal_logic/summaries/01_modal-logic-summary.md

Phases completed: 3/3

Status: [COMPLETED]
```

**Assigned Commands:** `/implement`, `/revise`, `/errors`

### Template C: Complex (15-25 lines)

For commands with grouped results, multiple sections, or interactive outcomes.

**Structure:**
```
{Action} Complete

{Primary result summary}

{Section 1}:
- {item}
- {item}

{Section 2} ({count}):
- {item}

{Optional metrics section}

Next Steps:
1. {step}
2. {step}
```

**Example:**
```
Archived 5 tasks

Completed (3):
- #245: Add LSP configuration
- #247: Fix parser edge case
- #251: Update documentation

Abandoned (2):
- #246: Deprecated approach
- #250: Superseded by #251

Directories moved: 5
Active tasks remaining: 12

Next Steps:
1. Review archive at specs/archive/
2. Run /review for codebase analysis
```

**Assigned Commands:** `/todo`, `/review`, `/meta`, `/fix-it`, `/refresh`

## Template Assignment Table

| Command | Template | Rationale |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| `/research` | Simple (A) | Single artifact, single next step |
| `/plan` | Simple (A) | Single artifact, single next step |
| `/task` | Simple (A) | Task creation confirmation |
| `/implement` | Standard (B) | Phase metrics, summary artifact |
| `/revise` | Standard (B) | Version info, key changes |
| `/errors` | Standard (B) | Error counts, pattern summary |
| `/todo` | Complex (C) | Grouped archives, multiple sections |
| `/review` | Complex (C) | Grouped issues, recommendations |
| `/meta` | Complex (C) | Multiple tasks, next steps |
| `/fix-it` | Complex (C) | Tag groups, task selections |
| `/refresh` | Complex (C) | Process/directory sections |

## Next Step Format

### Single Next Step

Use `Next: /{command} {N}` format (no bold, single line):

```
Next: /plan 258
```

### Multiple Next Steps

Use `Next Steps:` header (capitalized, no bold) with numbered list:

```
Next Steps:
1. Review tasks in TODO.md
2. Run /research 650 to begin
3. Progress through /research -> /plan -> /implement cycle
```

**Avoid:**
- `**Next Steps**:` (bold)
- `**Next**:` (bold)
- `Next: /implement {N} to fix` (action description in next step)

## Summary Requirements

### Token Limit
- **Maximum**: 100 tokens (~400 characters)
- **Target**: 50-75 tokens (~200-300 characters)
- **Enforcement**: Subagent return format standard enforces this limit

### Content Guidelines
- **Focus**: What was accomplished and key outcomes
- **Avoid**: Implementation details, verbose explanations
- **Include**: Status, key results
- **Tone**: Clear, concise, informative

### Summary Structure
1. **First sentence**: What was accomplished
2. **Second sentence** (optional): Key outcome or result

**Good Example:**
```
Research completed for modal logic proof automation. Created comprehensive analysis
of LeanSearch API integration patterns.
```

**Bad Example (too verbose):**
```
I have completed the research phase for task 258 which involves modal logic proof
automation. During this research, I analyzed the LeanSearch API documentation,
reviewed existing proof search implementations, evaluated different integration
patterns, and created a detailed report with recommendations for implementation.
```

## No Summary Conclusions

**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT add conclusions or closing statements after the output.

The output already provides task/command context. Adding a conclusion like "Task 258 completed" or "Command /review finished" is redundant.

**Correct:**
```
Research completed for Task #258

Report: specs/258_modal_logic_automation/reports/01_modal-logic-research.md

Status: [RESEARCHED]
Next: /plan 258
```

**Incorrect (redundant conclusion):**
```
Research completed for Task #258

Report: specs/258_modal_logic_automation/reports/01_modal-logic-research.md

Status: [RESEARCHED]
Next: /plan 258

Task 258 research completed successfully.  ← REDUNDANT, DO NOT ADD
```

## Artifact Display

### Console Output Format

Use labeled paths for console output:

```
Report: specs/258_modal_logic/reports/01_modal-logic-research.md
Plan: specs/258_modal_logic/plans/02_modal-logic-plan.md
Summary: specs/258_modal_logic/summaries/01_modal-logic-summary.md
```

### Markdown File Format

Use markdown links in files (reports, plans, summaries):

```markdown
- [01_research-findings.md](../reports/01_research-findings.md)
- [02_implementation-plan.md](../plans/02_implementation-plan.md)
```

## Error Display

### Format
```
{Action} failed for Task #{N}

Error: {error_message}

Recommendation: {how_to_fix}
```

### Example
```
Research failed for Task #999

Error: Task not found in specs/TODO.md

Recommendation: Verify task number and retry
```

## Implementation Notes

### Command Responsibility
- Commands format their own output following assigned template
- Use template assignment table to determine correct format
- Summaries from skills/agents are incorporated into template structure

### Template Selection
- Simple (A): Commands returning single artifact with linear workflow
- Standard (B): Commands with metrics, multiple artifacts, or completion states
- Complex (C): Commands with grouped results, interactive selection, or multiple sections

### Consistency Checks
- Task number format: Always `Task #{N}` (no colon after)
- Next step format: `Next: /cmd {N}` (single) or `Next Steps:` (multiple)
- Status markers: `[STATUS]` format (e.g., `[COMPLETED]`, `[RESEARCHED]`)
- No bold in next step headers
- No action descriptions in next step (e.g., avoid "to fix", "to begin")
