# Lean 4 Development Rules

## CRITICAL: Blocked MCP Tools

**DO NOT call**: `lean_diagnostic_messages` (hangs), `lean_file_outline` (unreliable)

Use `lean_goal` + `lake build` instead.

## Essential MCP Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `lean_goal` | Proof state at position - MOST IMPORTANT |
| `lean_hover_info` | Type signatures + docs |
| `lean_completions` | IDE autocomplete |
| `lean_local_search` | Fast local declaration search |
| `lean_verify` | Axiom check + source scan (use fully qualified name) |
| `lean_multi_attempt` | Test tactics without editing - use BEFORE applying edits |

## Search Tools (Rate Limited)

| Tool | Rate | Query Style |
|------|------|-------------|
| `lean_leansearch` | 3/30s | Natural language |
| `lean_loogle` | 3/30s | Type pattern |
| `lean_leanfinder` | 10/30s | Semantic concept |
| `lean_state_search` | 3/30s | Goal -> closing lemmas |
| `lean_hammer_premise` | 3/30s | Goal -> simp/aesop hints |

## Search Decision Tree

1. "Does X exist locally?" -> `lean_local_search`
2. "Lemma that says X" -> `lean_leansearch`
3. "Type pattern match" -> `lean_loogle`
4. "Lean name for concept" -> `lean_leanfinder`
5. "What closes this goal?" -> `lean_state_search`

## Workflow Pattern

1. After finding name: `lean_local_search` -> verify, `lean_hover_info` -> signature
2. During proof (inner loop): `lean_goal` constantly; `lean_multi_attempt` BEFORE editing; `lean_verify` for axiom/sorry check
3. After editing a step: `lean_goal` to confirm; `lean_verify` if axiom safety needed
4. Phase-end: `lake build Module.Name` (scoped); fall back to `lake build` if module name unknown
5. Final verification only: `lake build` (full project)

## Common Tactics

Automation: `simp`, `aesop`, `omega`, `ring`, `decide`
Structure: `intro`, `apply`, `exact`, `constructor`, `cases`, `induction`
Rewriting: `rw`, `simp only`, `conv`

## Build Commands

Prefer scoped: `lake build Module.Name` | Full project: `lake build` | Clean: `lake clean && lake build`

**When to use each**:
- `lake build Module.Name` -- phase-end verification (preferred; faster)
- `lake build` -- final verification only (after all phases complete)

## Literature Fidelity

When a literature source (paper, textbook, proof sketch) is referenced in the task or plan:

- **Follow the source step-by-step** -- do not seek shortcuts or alternative proofs
- **FORBIDDEN**: Using `simp`/`omega`/`aesop` to bypass steps the literature handles explicitly
- **FORBIDDEN**: Abandoning the literature's approach after a single tactic failure
- **FORBIDDEN**: Mixing literature steps with novel steps without flagging the deviation
- **Escalation**: Re-read source -> try alternative Lean encodings -> check for unstated lemmas -> flag gap to user
- **No literature referenced?** First-principles mode: all tactics and strategies permitted freely

See `literature-fidelity-policy.md` for full policy, anti-pattern catalog, and escalation protocol.

## Vacuous Definitions (PROHIBITED)

The following definition patterns are **strictly prohibited** and are semantically equivalent to `sorry`. They create no real proof obligation and will be caught by the Zero-Debt Verification Gate.

### Prohibited Patterns

```lean
-- def variants
def Foo := True
def Foo := Unit
def Foo := trivial
def Foo := Trivial
noncomputable def Foo := True

-- theorem variants
theorem Foo := True
theorem Foo := trivial
theorem Foo := Trivial

-- lemma variants
lemma Foo := True
lemma Foo := trivial
lemma Foo := Trivial

-- instance variants
instance Foo := trivial
instance Foo := True
```

### Why These Are Prohibited

- `def X := True` compiles but proves nothing about `X`'s actual semantics
- `theorem X := trivial` only type-checks when the goal is literally `True`, not the real goal
- These patterns paper over inability to implement by substituting a semantically empty placeholder
- They are indistinguishable from `sorry` in terms of proof value: the definition exists but the intent is unfulfilled

### What to Do Instead

If you cannot implement `X`:
1. Mark the phase **[BLOCKED]** in the plan file
2. Document the blocker with what was tried, what goal state was reached, and what is needed to unblock
3. Return `status: "partial"` with `requires_user_review: true`
4. **Do NOT create `def X := True` or any vacuous placeholder**

The Escalation Protocol in `lean-implementation-agent.md` specifies the exact procedure.
