## Overview

The **Theory Library Documentation** provides comprehensive guides for using, understanding, and extending the ModelChecker's semantic theory collection. This documentation serves different audiences from researchers exploring semantic theories to developers implementing new theoretical frameworks.

The documentation covers **practical usage patterns**, **architectural design principles**, **implementation guidelines**, and **testing methodologies** to ensure effective use and development of semantic theories within the ModelChecker ecosystem.

This resource collection supports the theory library's role as a **computational platform for logic research**, enabling systematic comparison between semantic approaches and facilitating the implementation of new theoretical frameworks.


## Subdirectories

This documentation hub organizes theory library resources for different development and research activities, providing targeted guidance for specific tasks and user types.
