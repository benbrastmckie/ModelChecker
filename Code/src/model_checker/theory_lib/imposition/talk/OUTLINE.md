# OUTLINE

- intro (5 min)
  - motivation: standard methodology
  - hard, slow, error prone
  - difficult to scale the expressive power of the language
- programmatic semantics (10 min)
  - SMT solvers (Z3)
  - bitvectors as states
  - primitive sorts in Z3
  - model-checker to facilitate
    - translate into Z3 constraints
    - find a model if there is one
    - use model to interpret and print
  - DEMO 1: IMPOSITION SEMANTICS
    - run examples
    - unit tests
- computational complexity as a theoretical virtue (10 min) -- MIGUEL
  - cost of a primitive scales exponentially with arity (go through space complexity)
  - compare one-place, two-place, and three-place
  - other?
  - DEMO MAXIMIZER FOR IMPOSITION SEMANTICS
- imposition defined (5 min)
  - maximal compatible parts
  - alternative worlds
  - semantics for counterfactuals
  - DEMO COMPARISON
- modality defined (5 min)
  - `\Box A := \top \boxright A` over `\Box A := \neg A \boxright \bot`
    - iterated modals don't force counterfactuals into the antecedent
    - intuitive reading: if anything were the case, A would be the case
  - imposition theory admits countermodels to this definition
    - many vacuous countermodels
    - but good logic
