## Overview

The **Logos Theory** implements hyperintensional semantics through a unified framework of logical operators organized into modular subtheories. Built on bilateral truthmaker semantics, Logos enables fine-grained semantic distinctions between propositions that are necessarily equivalent, capturing differences in content and subject-matter that intensional semantic frameworks overlook.

Within the ModelChecker framework, Logos provides a flexible semantic theory where users can select which subtheories to include based on their analysis needs. The modular architecture supports loading individual subtheories (e.g., just modal and constitutive) or any combination, with automatic dependency resolution ensuring semantic coherence. This design supports both focused investigations using specific operators and comprehensive analyses using multiple subtheories.

### Available Subtheories

Logos provides the following subtheories, which can be loaded individually or in combination:

- **extensional**: Basic logical operators (∧, ∨, ¬, →, ↔, ⊤, ⊥)
- **modal**: Necessity and possibility operators (□, ◇, CFBox, CFDiamond)  
- **constitutive**: Content relation operators (≡, ≤, ⊑, ≼, ⊓)
- **counterfactual**: Counterfactual conditionals (□→, ◇→)
- **relevance**: Relevance logic operator (≼)

When creating a project, you can select specific subtheories:
```bash
model-checker -l logos modal constitutive  # Only modal and constitutive
model-checker -l logos                     # Default subtheories
model-checker -l logos all                 # All subtheories
```

## Subdirectories

### [docs/](docs/)

Comprehensive documentation hub containing theoretical foundations, API specifications, and practical guides. Includes technical architecture details explaining the bilateral semantic implementation, complete API reference for all 19 operators, model iteration documentation, configuration settings guide, and user-friendly introduction to hyperintensional logic. Essential resource for understanding both theoretical principles and practical usage. See [docs/README.md](docs/README.md) for navigation.

### [subtheories/](subtheories/)

Modular operator organization containing the available subtheories. Each subtheory is self-contained with its own operators, examples, tests, and documentation. Users can select which subtheories to include when creating a project. The framework handles dependencies automatically - for example, loading constitutive will also load extensional as it depends on basic logical operators. See [subtheories/README.md](subtheories/README.md) for detailed information about each subtheory.

### [notebooks/](notebooks/)

Interactive Jupyter notebooks providing hands-on tutorials for hyperintensional reasoning. Includes theory introduction, operator exploration across all subtheories, semantic distinction demonstrations, and practical problem-solving examples. Ideal for learning through experimentation and visualization of semantic concepts. See [notebooks/README.md](notebooks/README.md) for tutorial navigation.

### [tests/](tests/)

Comprehensive test suite validating the unified Logos theory implementation. Contains cross-subtheory integration tests ensuring operators work correctly together, semantic coherence validation, and the complete 177-example test collection. Tests verify both individual operator behavior and complex interactions between subtheories. See [tests/README.md](tests/README.md) for testing methodology.

## Operator Summary

The complete Logos theory includes the following operators organized by subtheory:

### Primitive Operators

**Extensional** (3):
- Negation (¬) - Truth reversal
- Conjunction (∧) - Joint truth requirement
- Top (⊤) - Universal truth

**Modal** (1):
- Necessity (□) - Truth at all worlds

**Constitutive** (3):
- Identity (≡) - Same verifiers and falsifiers
- Ground (≤) - Sufficient condition relation
- Relevance (≼) - Content connection relation

### Defined Operators (12)

**Extensional** (4):
- Disjunction (∨) - Alternative truth
- Implication (→) - Conditional truth
- Biconditional (↔) - Mutual implication
- Bottom (⊥) - Universal falsity

**Modal** (3):
- Possibility (◇) - Truth at some world
- Counterfactual Necessity (CFBox) - Counterfactual from ⊤
- Counterfactual Possibility (CFDiamond) - Could counterfactual from ⊤

**Constitutive** (2):
- Essence (⊑) - Necessary condition relation
- Subject Matter (⊓) - Common content

**Counterfactual** (2):
- Must Counterfactual (□→) - Would be the case
- Could Counterfactual (◇→) - Could be the case

**Relevance** (1):
- Relevance (≺) - Imported from constitutive

## Semantic Theory

### Bilateral Truthmaker Semantics

Logos implements a bilateral semantics where propositions are characterized by:

- **Verifiers**: States that make the proposition true
- **Falsifiers**: States that make the proposition false

This creates a non-Boolean algebraic structure enabling distinctions between:
- Logically equivalent propositions: `A ∧ B` vs `B ∧ A`
- Necessarily equivalent propositions: `□A` vs `¬◇¬A`
- Different grounding structures: `A` vs `A ∨ (B ∧ ¬B)`

### Key Innovations

1. **Hyperintensional Distinctions**: Captures content differences invisible to classical logic
2. **Modular Architecture**: Selective operator loading with automatic dependencies
3. **Cross-Domain Integration**: Unified treatment of modal, counterfactual, and relevance logic
4. **Bilateral Evaluation**: Both verification and falsification conditions

### Theoretical Applications

- Philosophy of language: Analyzing propositional content and aboutness
- Metaphysics: Grounding and essence relations
- Logic: Non-classical inference patterns and relevance logic
- AI/Cognitive Science: Formal models of thought and reasoning

## Examples

### Example Categories

Each subtheory includes comprehensive examples testing valid and invalid inferences:

- **Extensional**: 14 examples (7 countermodels, 7 theorems)
- **Modal**: 18 examples (4 countermodels, 14 theorems)
- **Constitutive**: 33 examples (18 countermodels, 15 theorems)
- **Counterfactual**: 33 examples (21 countermodels, 12 theorems)
- **Relevance**: 20 examples (11 countermodels, 9 theorems)

When loading specific subtheories, only the relevant examples are included.

### Running Examples

```bash
# Run all examples
model-checker src/model_checker/theory_lib/logos/examples.py

# Run with debugging output
./dev_cli.py -p -z src/model_checker/theory_lib/logos/examples.py

# Run specific subtheory examples
model-checker src/model_checker/theory_lib/logos/subtheories/modal/examples.py
```

## Model Iteration

The Logos theory provides enhanced model iteration capabilities that display rich semantic differences between models:

### Difference Types Tracked

When iterating through models, Logos tracks and displays:

1. **Verification Changes**: Which states verify/falsify propositions differently
2. **Falsification Changes**: Bilateral complement to verification  
3. **Parthood Relations**: Changes in hyperintensional part-whole structure
4. **World Changes**: Addition/removal of possible worlds
5. **Possible State Changes**: Changes in state possibility

### Example Output

```
=== DIFFERENCES FROM PREVIOUS MODEL ===

World Changes:
  + a.b (now a world)

Verification Changes:
  Letter A:
    + a.b now verifies A
    - c no longer verifies A
  Letter B:
    + d now verifies B

Falsification Changes:
  Letter A:
    + c now falsifies A

Part-of Relation Changes:
  + a ⊑ a.b
```

This enhanced difference display helps researchers understand the semantic variations between models, particularly useful for analyzing hyperintensional distinctions.

### Implementation Details

The `LogosModelIterator` class in `iterate.py` extends the base iteration framework with:
- Comprehensive `_calculate_logos_differences()` method tracking all semantic changes
- `iterate_generator()` override that merges theory-specific differences with generic ones
- Data structure transformation to match display expectations
- Support for all logos subtheories (modal, counterfactual, constitutive, relevance, extensional)

## Testing

The Logos theory includes comprehensive testing across multiple levels:

```bash
# Run all Logos tests

# Run subtheory tests
pytest src/model_checker/theory_lib/logos/subtheories/modal/tests/

4. Run all cells to see the examples in action

All notebooks use LaTeX notation for formulas (e.g., `\Box` for □) as required by the parser.
