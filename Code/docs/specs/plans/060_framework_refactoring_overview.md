# Plan 060: Framework-Wide Refactoring Overview

**Status:** Active  
**Created:** 2025-01-09  
**Updated:** 2025-01-10 (models/ completed, tests/ completed, jupyter/ completed, output/ completed with 97% test coverage)  
**Priority:** Critical  
**Scope:** All ModelChecker subpackages requiring maintenance standards compliance  
**Dependencies:** Plan 059 (Maintenance Standards Enhancement) - Completed  

## Overview

This plan coordinates the systematic refactoring of all ModelChecker subpackages to achieve compliance with the maintenance standards established in Plan 059. Based on comprehensive analysis, packages are prioritized by urgency considering risk, impact, and current state.

## Analysis Foundation

This plan is based on comprehensive package analyses:
- [026: Builder Package Analysis](../research/026_builder_maintenance_standards_analysis.md) - 92% compliance (exemplar)
- [027: Settings/Output Analysis](../research/027_settings_output_maintenance_analysis.md) - 78%/72% compliance
- [028: Iterate/Models Analysis](../research/028_iterate_models_maintenance_analysis.md) - 76%/63% compliance  
- [029: Syntactic/Jupyter Analysis](../research/029_syntactic_jupyter_maintenance_analysis.md) - 82%/71% compliance
- [030: Utils/Tests Analysis](../research/030_utils_tests_maintenance_analysis.md) - 87%/71% compliance
- [031: Comprehensive Framework Analysis](../research/031_comprehensive_package_maintenance_analysis.md) - Framework overview

## Refactoring Priority Order

## Success Metrics

### Package-Level Targets
| Package | Current | Target | Priority | Status |
|---------|---------|--------|----------|---------|
| models/ | 63% | 95% | Critical | âœ… Complete (95%) |
| tests/ | 71% | 95% | High | âœ… Complete (95%) |

| iterate/ | 76% | 95% | Medium | âœ… Complete (92%) |
| settings/ | 78% | 95% | Low | Pending |

### Framework-Level Goals
- **Overall Compliance**: 78.6% â†’ 95%+ 
- **Minimum Package**: 63% â†’ 95%+
- **Test Coverage**: Maintain or improve
- **Zero Regression**: All tests passing throughout

## Implementation Approach

### Methodology
Each package refactor follows the proven 4-phase approach:

**Phase 1: Foundation Cleanup**
- Import organization standardization
- Code style consistency
- UTF-8 encoding verification

**Phase 2: Method Refinement**
- Extract methods exceeding complexity guidelines
- Maintain functional cohesion
- Preserve domain-appropriate complexity

**Phase 3: Error Handling Standardization**
- Implement package-specific error hierarchies
- Enhance error context and messages
- Follow BuilderError model

**Phase 4: Architectural Improvements**
- Apply protocol-based patterns where beneficial
- Implement dependency injection
- Enhance component separation

### Validation Strategy
1. **Pre-refactor**: Full test suite pass
2. **Per-phase**: Incremental testing
3. **Post-refactor**: Comprehensive validation
4. **Cross-package**: Integration testing

## Risk Management

### High-Risk Areas
- **models/ package**: Incomplete refactor state
- **Test infrastructure**: Changes affect all validation
- **Cross-package dependencies**: Careful coordination needed

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Incremental commits**: Small, validated changes
2. **Feature branches**: Isolate refactoring work
3. **Continuous testing**: Validate at each step
4. **Rollback capability**: Clean git history
