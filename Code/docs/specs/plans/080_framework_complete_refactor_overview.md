# Plan 080: Framework Complete Refactor Overview

**Status:** Approved
**Priority:** P1 (Critical)
**Timeline:** 19 weeks (extended for jupyter, settings, and documentation packages)
**Dependencies:** Research 041 (Compliance Audit), Research 042 (Theory_lib Analysis), Research 043 (Output Issues)

## Executive Summary

This plan orchestrates the complete refactoring of all ModelChecker packages to achieve 90%+ compliance with maintenance standards. The output package takes **immediate priority** due to failing tests and broken functionality, followed by packages with 0% type hints, then other packages by criticality (except theory_lib, which is deliberately scheduled last due to its complexity and size).

### Progress Update

**9 of 10 core tasks completed (90%)** - output, syntactic, utils, models, builder, iterate, jupyter, settings packages, and test coverage verification have all achieved their targets. The builder package notably achieved 100/100 compliance with full type coverage. Test coverage improvements added 47 new passing tests, with jupyter improving by +15% and utils by +8%.

## Package Priority Order

Based on Research 041's compliance audit and Research 043's critical findings, packages are ordered by:

1. **Broken functionality** (output package with failing tests - HIGHEST PRIORITY)
2. **Criticality of issues** (packages with 0% type hints next)
3. **Impact on other packages** (core dependencies)
4. **Size and complexity** (smaller packages for quick wins)
5. **Theory_lib last** (due to its size and complexity)

## Risk Management

### High Risk Areas

1. **theory_lib complexity** - 597 functions across 27 files
2. **Breaking changes** - No backward compatibility maintained
3. **Time estimates** - Large packages may take longer

### Mitigation Strategies

1. **Incremental approach** - Package by package, file by file
2. **Comprehensive testing** - Run full test suite after each change
3. **Automation tools** - Scripts for type hint generation
4. **Feature branches** - Isolate changes until validated

## Quality Assurance

### Proven Implementation Protocols

The following protocols have been successfully validated during syntactic package refactor:

#### Type Safety Protocol

1. **Create types.py module** with comprehensive type definitions:
   - Type aliases for domain-specific strings (`FormulaString`, `OperatorName`)
   - Recursive list types for structured data (`PrefixList`)
   - Protocol definitions for interfaces (`ISemantics`)
   - Z3-specific type aliases (`AtomType`)

2. **Implement comprehensive type hints:**
   - All function parameters and return types
   - Class attribute annotations
   - Forward references using `TYPE_CHECKING` imports
   - Generic type parameters where applicable

3. **Protocol-based design patterns:**
   - Define interface requirements as protocols
   - Enable flexible semantic integration
   - Support duck typing with type safety

#### Error Handling Protocol

1. **Context-aware error handling:**
   - Custom exception classes with detailed context
   - Validation at input boundaries (e.g., empty formula checking)
   - Meaningful error messages for debugging

2. **Import organization:**
   - Use `TYPE_CHECKING` to avoid circular imports
   - Separate runtime and type-checking imports
   - Clear dependency management

#### Testing Protocol

1. **Package-specific validation:** `./run_tests.py <package>` (all tests must pass)
2. **Full suite validation:** `./run_tests.py` (ensure no regressions)
3. **Manual functionality verification**

#### Documentation Protocol

1. **Update capability lists** to include new type safety features
2. **Enhance code examples** with proper type annotations
3. **Document new architecture patterns** (protocols, error handling)
4. **Maintain example accuracy** and verify all code works

### Testing Requirements

Each package refactor must follow this rigorous process:

#### Phase 0: Specification Review & Research

**Before starting any implementation:**

1. Review associated spec files for the package (e.g., Plan 081 for syntactic)
2. Research actual codebase structure and validate spec accuracy
3. Improve and correct spec files to match reality
4. Ensure spec files comply with `Code/maintenance/` standards
5. Verify implementation examples are realistic and accurate

#### Phase 1: Implementation & Testing

1. **Implement refactor changes systematically:**
   - Create types.py with type aliases and protocols
   - Add comprehensive type hints to all functions and methods
   - Implement proper error handling with context-aware exceptions
   - Use TYPE_CHECKING for forward references to avoid circular imports
   - Follow Protocol-based design patterns for interfaces
2. **Test rigorously:**
   - Run package-specific tests: `./run_tests.py <package>`
   - Run FULL test suite: `./run_tests.py` (no arguments)
   - Perform manual testing of key functionality
   - Validate type hints with mypy (if applicable)

#### Phase 2: Documentation Update

**Only after ALL tests pass:**

1. **Review documentation standards** in `Docs/maintenance/`
2. **Update all README files** in the package with:
   - New type safety information and capabilities
   - Updated code examples showing proper type annotations
   - Enhanced section on protocol-based design patterns
   - Documentation of new error handling improvements
3. **Ensure documentation reflects actual implementation**
4. **Cross-check that examples in docs work correctly**
5. **Update any related documentation** in other packages

### Validation Checkpoints

- **After Each Change:** Run affected tests
- **Before Documentation:** Run FULL test suite
- **After Documentation:** Manual verification of examples
- **Per Package Completion:** Generate compliance report
- **Final:** Complete framework audit with all tests passing

## Resource Requirements

### Developer Time

- **Total:** 17 weeks full-time equivalent (reduced from 18)
- **Emergency fix:** 1 week (output)
- **Critical packages:** 3 weeks (syntactic, utils)
- **Core packages:** 4 weeks (models, builder, iterate)
- **Additional packages:** 2 weeks (jupyter, settings)
- **Quality assurance:** 3 weeks (decorator removal, test coverage, documentation) - optimization voided
- **Theory library:** 5 weeks

### Tooling

- **mypy** - Type checking
- **pytest** - Test validation
- **coverage** - Test coverage metrics
- **Custom scripts** - Type hint generation

## Implementation Order Rationale

### Why This Order?

1. **output first** - BROKEN FUNCTIONALITY, failing tests, needs immediate fix
2. **syntactic second** - Most critical (0% types, no errors), small scope
3. **utils third** - Critical (0% types), utilities used everywhere
4. **models fourth** - Core data structures, manageable size
5. **builder fifth** - Important but already decent, larger scope
6. **iterate sixth** - Recent improvements, just needs types
7. **theory_lib last** - Most complex, largest scope, needs dedicated effort

### Why Theory_lib Last?

1. **Size:** 597 functions vs. others with <420
2. **Complexity:** Multiple interconnected theories
3. **Dependencies:** Benefits from other refactors being complete
4. **Learning:** Apply lessons learned from other packages
5. **Focus:** Requires undivided attention

## Success Metrics

13. **[Plan 086: Theory_lib Complete Refactor](086_theory_lib_complete_refactor.md)** - Weeks 15-19

## Conclusion

This systematic refactoring will transform the ModelChecker framework from 71% to 90%+ compliance over 19 weeks. By **prioritizing the broken output package first**, then addressing critical packages with 0% type hints, adding quality assurance phases, and leaving the complex theory_lib for last, we ensure immediate restoration of functionality while building toward comprehensive framework quality.

The investment in code quality will yield:

- **Better maintainability** through type safety
- **Improved reliability** via error handling
- **Enhanced developer experience** with IDE support
- **Reduced bugs** from static analysis
- **Faster onboarding** for contributors
