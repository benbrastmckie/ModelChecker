   - Test boolean evaluation paths
   - Add parameter validation tests

### Phase 2: Integration Testing (87% → 90%)

**Effort**: 8-12 hours  
**Target Files**: core.py, graph.py

1. **Create Integration Test Suite**
   - Test full iteration scenarios
   - Use real semantic theories
   - Test isomorphism detection

2. **Mock-Based Orchestration Tests**
   - Test core.py coordination logic
   - Mock component interactions
   - Test error recovery paths

### Phase 3: Generator Testing (90% → 95%)

**Effort**: 16-24 hours  
**Target Files**: iterator.py

1. **Sophisticated Generator Tests**
   - Create test harness for iterate()
   - Test all exit conditions
   - Test state transitions

2. **Property-Based Testing**
   - Use hypothesis for invariant testing
   - Test generator properties
   - Ensure correctness under all conditions

## Specific Test Additions Needed

### High-Value Test Scenarios

1. **Iterator Generator Tests** (Impact: +15% coverage)
   ```python
   def test_iterate_with_real_theory():
       """Test iteration with actual semantic theory"""
       # Use logos or exclusion theory
       # Run full iteration
       # Verify model properties
   ```

2. **Error Recovery Tests** (Impact: +5% coverage)
   ```python
   def test_iteration_recovery_from_z3_failure():
       """Test graceful recovery from Z3 errors"""
       # Inject Z3 failures at various points
       # Verify iteration continues or stops gracefully
   ```

3. **Isomorphism Edge Cases** (Impact: +3% coverage)
   ```python
   def test_complex_isomorphism_detection():
       """Test isomorphism with complex graphs"""
       # Create models with subtle differences
       # Verify correct detection
   ```

## Technical Debt and Refactoring Opportunities

### Testability Issues

1. **Large Methods**
   - `iterate()` method: 224 lines
   - `_orchestrated_iterate()`: 219 lines
   - Consider extracting helper methods

2. **Deep Dependencies**
   - Strong coupling to Z3
   - Complex mock requirements
   - Consider dependency injection

3. **Generator Complexity**
   - Stateful generator pattern
   - Multiple yield points
   - Consider state machine approach

### Refactoring Recommendations

1. **Extract Method Refactoring**
   - Break down iterate() into smaller pieces
   - Create testable units
   - Maintain domain complexity

2. **Dependency Injection**
   - Make Z3 solver injectable
   - Allow test doubles
   - Improve mockability

3. **State Pattern**
   - Consider state machine for iteration
   - Make states explicit
   - Easier to test transitions

## Coverage Comparison with Other Packages

| Package | Coverage | Tests | Status |
|---------|----------|-------|--------|
| output | 97% | 89 | Excellent |
| builder | 92% | 156 | Excellent |
| **iterate** | **85%** | **142** | Good |
| jupyter | 78% | 112 | Fair |
| theory_lib | 72% | 234 | Fair |

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Week 1)
1. Add 10-15 simple tests for constraints.py and models.py edge cases
2. Create integration test suite for core.py orchestration
3. Document test patterns for generator testing

### Short-term Goals (Month 1)
1. Achieve 90% coverage through integration tests
2. Create test fixtures for common scenarios
3. Add property-based tests for invariants

### Long-term Strategy (Quarter)
1. Refactor iterator.py for better testability
2. Achieve 95% coverage target
3. Establish continuous coverage monitoring

## Conclusion

The iterate package has solid test coverage at 85% with all 142 tests passing. The main gaps are in complex generator code (iterator.py) and orchestration logic (core.py). These areas require sophisticated testing approaches including:

1. Integration tests with real semantic theories
2. Mock-heavy unit tests for orchestration
3. Property-based testing for invariants

The path to 90% coverage is clear and achievable with focused effort on integration testing and error path coverage. Reaching 95% will require either sophisticated generator testing or refactoring for improved testability.

### Key Metrics Summary
- **Current Coverage**: 85% (3462 statements, 533 missing)
- **Test Count**: 142 (all passing)
- **Critical Gaps**: iterator.py (37%), core.py (55%)
- **Next Target**: 90% coverage
- **Effort Required**: 24-40 hours for 90% target
