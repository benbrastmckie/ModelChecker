**Phase 1: Foundation Cleanup** ‚úÖ
- Import organization standardization across all packages shows consistent application
- UTF-8 encoding and style consistency maintained framework-wide

**Phase 2: Method Refinement** ‚úÖ 
- builder/ `process_example` method (187 ‚Üí 35 lines) demonstrates successful extraction
- Similar opportunities identified in output/, jupyter/, and models/ packages

**Phase 3: Error Handling Standardization** ‚úÖ

### 2. Utility Organization Excellence

The **utils/ package (87% compliance)** demonstrates optimal utility patterns:

```
utils/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ api.py              # Theory access functions (cross-package)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ bitvector.py        # Z3 bit vector operations (domain-specific)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ context.py          # Z3 context management (infrastructure)  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ formatting.py       # Output formatting (presentation)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ parsing.py          # Expression parsing (domain-specific)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ testing.py          # Test utilities (infrastructure)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ version.py          # Version management (infrastructure)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ z3_helpers.py       # Z3 wrapper functions (integration)
```

**Success Factors:**
- **Categorical organization** by function, not arbitrary grouping
