# OpenCode Agent System Documentation

[Back to Theory](../../README.md) | [Architecture](../README.md) | [README.md](../../README.md)

This directory contains the documentation for the `.opencode/` agent system. The system provides structured task management, research workflows, and implementation automation for Logos/Theory development. For comprehensive system details, see [architecture/system-overview.md](architecture/system-overview.md).

## System Architecture

The `.opencode/` directory implements a three-layer architecture: Commands, Skills, and Agents, with checkpoint-based execution and language-specific routing. All system details, including the task lifecycle, state management, and git integration patterns, are documented in [architecture/system-overview.md](architecture/system-overview.md).
