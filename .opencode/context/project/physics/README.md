# Physics Context README

## Purpose

Physics domain knowledge for formal methods and formalization. Currently contains dynamical systems formalization patterns. This directory is designed for future expansion as physics-related formal methods are developed.

## Directory Structure

| Directory | Content |
|-----------|---------|
| `dynamical-systems/` | Lean 4 patterns for discrete/continuous dynamical systems, fixed points, flows |

## Canonical Files

### Dynamical Systems
- `dynamical-systems/dynamical-systems.md` - Core definitions: iteration, orbits, fixed points, periodic points, flows

## Current Scope

The physics context is **minimal by design**. Current content covers:
- Discrete dynamical systems (iteration, orbits)
- Fixed and periodic points
- Continuous flows on topological spaces
- Mathlib4 integration patterns

## Future Directions

Potential expansion areas:
- Hamiltonian mechanics formalization
- Conservation laws and Noether's theorem
- Statistical mechanics foundations
- Connections to temporal logic semantics
- Quantum mechanics formalization

## Related Context

- `project/math/topology/` - Topological foundations for continuous systems
- `project/math/order-theory/` - Well-foundedness for termination analysis
- `project/logic/domain/` - Temporal logic with potential physics applications
