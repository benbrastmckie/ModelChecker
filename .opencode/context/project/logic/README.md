# Logic Context README

## Purpose

Canonical proof principles, notation, and strategies for mathematical logic (modal, temporal, epistemic). This directory provides domain knowledge for formal logic research agents.

## Terminology Conventions

### Sentence Letters (Preferred Term)

In all logic documentation, use **"sentence letter"** instead of "propositional atom" or "propositional variable":

| Preferred Term | Avoid | Usage |
|----------------|-------|-------|
| sentence letter | propositional atom | Documentation, comments, descriptions |
| sentence letters | propositional variables | Plural references |
| sentence letter | atomic proposition | When referring to syntax |

**Rationale**: "Sentence letter" is the standard term in philosophical logic and modal logic literature. It clearly indicates a syntactic placeholder for a declarative sentence.

## Directory Structure

| Directory | Content |
|-----------|---------|
| `domain/` | Core concepts: Kripke semantics, metalogic, proof theory, task semantics |
| `processes/` | Proof strategies: modal proofs, temporal proofs, construction patterns |
| `standards/` | Conventions: naming, notation, proof conventions |
