## Overview

This directory contains comprehensive documentation about the programmatic semantic methodology that guides the ModelChecker package design and workflow. The methodology documentation is designed to be accessible to an interdisciplinary audience including logicians, linguists, computer scientists, and AI researchers with expertise in some but not all of these areas.

The ModelChecker implements a programmatic methodology for developing semantic theories. This approach separates syntactic processing from semantic interpretation. The premises and conclusions of a given inference are the used to generate Z3 constraints which, if satisfied by a model, are then interpreted by extracting the elements from that model. This approach provides a general methodology by which to support the study of arbitrary logical theories while maintaining a consistent computational pipeline.

The framework treats semantic theories as executable programs, where truth conditions become Z3 constraints and models are data structures. This programmatic approach allows researchers to rapidly implement and test semantic theories, comparing different approaches to logical phenomena through concrete counterexamples and model generation.

## Theory Examples

### Example Pipeline

The framework orchestrates a sophisticated transformation from logical formulas to semantic models through five interconnected stages:

**1. Syntactic Analysis and Operator Discovery**

The parser receives logical formulas like `"(A \\wedge B)"` and `"(B \\boxright C)"` without prior knowledge of their operators. Through structural analysis, it discovers `\\wedge` and `\\boxright` as operators, constructs abstract syntax trees in prefix notation, and builds a dependency graph of sentence complexity. This language-agnostic approach allows the framework to support arbitrary logical languages without hardcoded operator definitions.

**2. Semantic Theory Instantiation**

Each semantic theory defines how logical operators behave through Z3 primitive functions. For truthmaker semantics, this means creating functions like `verify: State × Sentence → Bool` and establishing mereological relations like `part_of` and `fusion`. The theory specifies that a sentence is true at a world when some state-part of that world verifies it - a non-trivial condition that differs fundamentally from classical possible-worlds semantics.

**3. Recursive Constraint Generation**

The framework traverses the syntax tree, generating Z3 constraints that capture the semantic behavior of each operator. For conjunction `(A ∧ B)`, it encodes that a state verifies the conjunction if and only if it's the fusion of states that verify A and B respectively. This recursive process handles arbitrary formula complexity while respecting the compositional structure of natural language semantics.

**4. SMT Solver Model Finding**

Z3 searches for variable assignments that satisfy all generated constraints simultaneously. With N=3, this means exploring 2³=8 possible states, their mereological relationships, and their verification patterns. The solver must balance frame constraints (like fusion closure), proposition constraints (like contingency), and the specific truth conditions of the argument.

**5. Model Extraction and Interpretation**

When Z3 finds a satisfying assignment, the framework extracts concrete extensions for each semantic primitive: which states exist, how they relate mereologically, what they verify or falsify, and ultimately which sentences are true at the evaluation world. This produces either a countermodel (demonstrating invalidity) or exhausts the search space (suggesting validity within the bounded model size).

The sophistication lies not in any single stage but in their integration: syntactic flexibility enables theory comparison, semantic theories encode complex philosophical proposals as executable code, constraint generation preserves compositional structure, and model extraction provides concrete interpretations that can reveal subtle logical phenomena invisible to pen-and-paper analysis.

### Theory Implementation Pattern

```python
# Implement a semantic theory as code
class HyperintensionalSemantics(SemanticDefaults):
    def __init__(self, settings):
        # Define Z3 primitives for states and relations
        self.verify = z3.Function('verify', StateSort, SentenceSort, z3.BoolSort())
        self.falsify = z3.Function('falsify', StateSort, SentenceSort, z3.BoolSort())
        self.possible = z3.Function('possible', StateSort, z3.BoolSort())
        
        # Define frame constraints using primitives
        x, y = z3.BitVecs("x y", self.N)
        possibility_downward_closure = ForAll([x, y],
            z3.Implies(
                z3.And(self.possible(y), self.is_part_of(x, y)),
                self.possible(x)
            )
        )
        self.frame_constraints = [possibility_downward_closure]

    def is_world(self, state):
        # Worlds defined as maximal possible states
        return z3.And(
            self.possible(state),
            self.maximal(state)
        )
    
    def maximal(self, state):
        # A state is maximal if it contains all compatible states
        x = z3.BitVec("max_x", self.N)
        return ForAll(x,
            z3.Implies(
                self.compatible(x, state),
                self.is_part_of(x, state)
            )
        )
    
    def compatible(self, state_x, state_y):
        # States are compatible if their fusion is possible
        return self.possible(self.fusion(state_x, state_y))

    def true_at(self, sentence, eval_point):
        # Truth conditions as executable code
        world = eval_point["world"]
        state = z3.BitVec("state", self.N)
        return z3.Exists([state],
            z3.And(
                self.is_part_of(state, world),
                self.verify(state, sentence)
            )
        )
```

### Model Iteration Example

```console
# Test counterfactual reasoning: ¬A, A □→ C ⊢ (A ∧ B) □→ C
model-checker counterfactual_examples.py --iterate=2

# Output:
EXAMPLE CF_CM_1: there is a countermodel.

State Space:
  □, a, b, c, d, a.c (world), b.c (world), a.d (world)
  a.b, b.d, c.d, a.b.c, a.b.d, a.c.d, b.c.d, a.b.c.d (impossible)

Evaluation world: b.c

INTERPRETED PREMISES:
1. |¬A| = < {b.c}, {a, a.b.c.d} >  (True in b.c)
   |A| = < {a, a.b.c.d}, {b.c} >  (False in b.c)

2. |(A □→ C)| = < {a.c, b.c}, {a.d} >  (True in b.c)
   |A|-alternatives to b.c = {a.c}
     |C| = < {a.c}, {a.b.c.d, a.b.d, a.d, b} >  (True in a.c)

INTERPRETED CONCLUSION:
3. |((A ∧ B) □→ C)| = < ∅, {a.c, a.d, b.c} >  (False in b.c)
   |(A ∧ B)|-alternatives to b.c = {a.d}
     |C| = < {a.c}, {a.b.c.d, a.b.d, a.d, b} >  (False in a.d)

Found 2/2 distinct models.
