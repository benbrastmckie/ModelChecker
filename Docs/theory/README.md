## Overview

This directory contains **theoretical documentation** explaining the academic foundations, research context, and implementation insights of the ModelChecker framework. These documents bridge the gap between pure theoretical logic and practical implementation, providing essential background for researchers, theory implementers, and anyone seeking to understand the deeper principles behind the framework.

The documentation covers **hyperintensional logic foundations**, **SMT solving techniques**, **comprehensive academic references**, and **implementation patterns** discovered through the development of multiple semantic theories. This theoretical grounding ensures that ModelChecker implementations remain faithful to their academic origins while providing practical tools for logical investigation.

## Theory Examples

### Understanding Hyperintensional Semantics

The theoretical foundations enable implementations that distinguish logically equivalent formulas:

```python
# Standard example following EXAMPLES.md format
from model_checker.theory_lib.logos import get_theory

theory = get_theory()

# Hyperintensional distinction example
HYP_CM_1_premises = ["A \\wedge B"]
HYP_CM_1_conclusions = ["B \\wedge A"]
HYP_CM_1_settings = {
    'N': 3,                    # Max atomic propositions
    'contingent': True,        # Allow contingent propositions
    'expectation': True        # True = expect countermodel
}
HYP_CM_1_example = [
    HYP_CM_1_premises,
    HYP_CM_1_conclusions,
    HYP_CM_1_settings
]

# In classical logic: valid (conjunction is commutative)
# In hyperintensional logic: may have countermodels due to different content

example_range = {"HYP_CM_1": HYP_CM_1_example}
semantic_theories = {"logos": theory}
```

### SMT Solving Approach

```python
# Z3 constraints represent semantic conditions
from z3 import Bool, And, Or, Not, Solver

# Truthmaker semantics encoded as SMT constraints
p = Bool('p')  # Proposition variable
v_pos = Bool('v_pos')  # Positive verifier
v_neg = Bool('v_neg')  # Negative verifier

# Bilateral satisfaction constraints
constraints = And(
    p == v_pos,      # p true iff positively verified
    Not(p) == v_neg  # ¬p true iff negatively verified
)
```
