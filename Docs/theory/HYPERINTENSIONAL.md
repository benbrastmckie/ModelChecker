## Introduction

Hyperintensional semantics provides a framework for making semantic distinctions that are invisible to classical intensional semantics. In the ModelChecker, hyperintensional theories use the bilateral **truthmaker semantics** pioneered by Kit Fine where propositions are characterized by their verifiers and falsifiers, allowing for fine-grained content distinctions even between necessarily equivalent formulas.

The key insight is that sentences are evaluated at **states** which may be partial rather than total, fixing the truth values of only some sentence letters. This allows the framework to distinguish between different ways of making a sentence true or false, allowing for fine-grained distinctions in content that track relevance and subject-matter. Hyperintensionality is especially important for implementing semantic clauses for explanatory operators which require the explanans to be wholly relevant to the explanandum.

## Core Concepts

### States and Fusion

States are the fundamental building blocks of hyperintensional semantics:

- **Representation**: States are modeled by bitvectors (e.g., `#b00101` has length 5)
- **State Fusion**: The operation `⊔` combines states using bitwise OR
  - Example: `#b00101 ⊔ #b11001 = #b11101`
- **Atomic States**: Exactly one bit set to 1 (e.g., `#b00100`)
- **Null State**: No bits set to 1 (e.g., `#b00000`)

**Notation in ModelChecker**:

```
States are named: a, b, c, ...
Fusions printed as: a.b (fusion of states a and b)
Part relation: `a ≤ b` iff `a ⊔ b = b`
```

### Possibility and Compatibility

The framework distinguishes between possible and impossible states:

- **Possible States**: States that can exist in the model (formally: `s ∈ P`)
- **Impossible States**: States that cannot exist (e.g., contradictory combinations)
- **Constraints**:
  - The null state must be possible
  - Every part of a possible state must be possible
- **Compatibility**: States `a` and `b` are compatible iff the fusion of `a` and `b` is possible (`a ∘ b iff a ⊔ b ∈ P`)

### Worlds and Evaluation

- **World State**: A possible state that is maximal with respect to compatibility
  - Formal definition: `w` is a world iff `w ∈ P` and for all `s ∈ P`, if `s ∘ w` then `s ⊑ w`
  - Contains every compatible state as a part
  - Represents a complete possible situation
- **Evaluation**: Formulas are evaluated at world states

### Alternative Worlds (Counterfactual Semantics)

Alternative worlds are central to the counterfactual subtheory of logos:

- **Definition**: An alternative world is obtained by imposing a state on an existing world
- **Formal**: `u` is an `x`-alternative to world `w` iff:
  1. `u` is a world (maximal possible state)
  2. `x ⊑ u` (the imposed state `x` is part of `u`)
  3. `u` contains a maximal compatible part of `w` with respect to `x`
  
- **Intuition**: When evaluating "if A were true, B would be true" at world `w`:
  - Find verifiers `x` of A (states that make A true)
  - For each verifier `x`, construct alternative worlds by:
    - Taking `x` and adding as much of `w` as possible while maintaining consistency
    - The result is a minimal change to `w` that accommodates `x`
  
- **Implementation**: The `is_alternative(u, x, w)` predicate checks:
  ```
  u is a world AND
  x is part of u AND
  exists z such that:
    z is part of u AND
    z is a maximal part of w compatible with x
  ```

- **Usage**: In counterfactual "A □→ B" evaluated at world `w`:
  - True iff for all A-verifiers `x` and all `x`-alternatives `u` to `w`, B is true at `u`
  - False iff there exists an A-verifier `x` and an `x`-alternative `u` where B is false

## Truthmaker Semantics

### Verifiers and Falsifiers

Propositions are ordered pairs consisting of two sets of states:

- **Verifiers**: States that make the proposition true
- **Falsifiers**: States that make the proposition false

**Key Properties**:

1. Both sets must be closed under fusion
2. Verifiers and falsifiers must be incompatible
3. Every possible state must be compatible with either a verifier or falsifier

### Truth Conditions

A sentence is:

- **True at world w**: `w ⊨ φ iff ∃s ⊑ w : s ⊩ φ` (w contains a verifier as a part)

## Logical Operators

### Extensional Operators

**Negation (¬)**:

- Verifiers: The falsifiers of the negated sentence
- Falsifiers: The verifiers of the negated sentence

**Conjunction (∧)**:

- Verifiers: Pairwise fusions of verifiers for each conjunct
- Falsifiers: Falsifiers for either conjunct (or fusions thereof)

**Disjunction (∨)**:

- Verifiers: Verifiers for either disjunct (or fusions thereof)
- Falsifiers: Pairwise fusions of falsifiers for each disjunct

**Properties**:

- Conjunction and disjunction are dual (De Morgan laws hold)
- Idempotence laws hold

See the [extensional/README.md](https://github.com/benbrastmckie/ModelChecker/blob/master/Code/src/model_checker/theory_lib/logos/subtheories/extensional/README.md) for further discussion.

### Modal Operators

**Necessity (□)**: "A must be the case"

- `w ⊨ □A iff ∀u : u ⊨ A` (A is true at every world)

**Possibility (◇)**: "A might be the case"

- `w ⊨ ◇A iff ∃u : u ⊨ A` (A is true at some world)

See the [modal/README.md](https://github.com/benbrastmckie/ModelChecker/blob/master/Code/src/model_checker/theory_lib/logos/subtheories/modal/README.md) for further discussion.

### Counterfactual Operators

For counterfactuals, we need the concept of **alternative worlds**:

Given world `w` and state `s`, an **s-alternative** to `w` is any world `u` that contains:

1. The state `s`
2. A maximal part of `w` that is compatible with `s`

**Would Counterfactual (□→)**: "If A were the case, B would be the case"

- `w ⊨ (A □→ B) iff ∀s ∀u : (s ⊩ A ∧ alt(u,s,w)) → u ⊨ B` (B is true at all A-alternatives)

**Could Counterfactual (◇→)**: "If A were the case, B could be the case"

- `w ⊨ (A ◇→ B) iff ∃s ∃u : (s ⊩ A ∧ alt(u,s,w)) ∧ u ⊨ B` (B is true at some A-alternative)

See the [counterfactual/README.md](https://github.com/benbrastmckie/ModelChecker/blob/master/Code/src/model_checker/theory_lib/logos/subtheories/counterfactual/README.md) for further discussion.

### Constitutive Operators

These operators capture hyperintensional relationships between propositions:

**Ground (≤)**: "A is sufficient for B"

- Every verifier for A is a verifier for B
- Fusion of falsifiers for A and B is a falsifier for B
- Every falsifier for B has a part that falsifies A

**Essence (⊑)**: "A is necessary for B"

- Fusion of verifiers for A and B is a verifier for B
- Every verifier for B has a part that verifies A
- Every falsifier for A is a falsifier for B

**Identity (≡)**: "A just is B"

- A and B have the same verifiers
- A and B have the same falsifiers

**Relevance (≼)**: "A is wholly relevant to B"

- Fusion of verifiers for A and B is a verifier for B
- Fusion of falsifiers for A and B is a falsifier for B

**Interdefinability**:

```
A ≤ B   :=  ¬A ⊑ ¬B  :=  (A ∨ B) ≡ B
A ⊑ B   :=  ¬A ≤ ¬B  :=  (A ∧ B) ≡ B
A ≡ B   :=  (A ≤ B) ∧ (B ≤ A)
A ≼ B   :=  (A ∧ B) ≤ B
```

See the [constitutive/README.md](https://github.com/benbrastmckie/ModelChecker/blob/master/Code/src/model_checker/theory_lib/logos/subtheories/constitutive/README.md) for further discussion.

## Implementation in ModelChecker

ModelChecker implements hyperintensional semantics through several theories:

### Logos Theory

The most comprehensive implementation with all operators:

```python
from model_checker.theory_lib import logos

# Load theory with all subtheories
theory = logos.get_theory()

# Check hyperintensional distinctions
model = BuildExample("hyperintensional", theory)
# (p ∧ ¬p) and (q ∧ ¬q) are necessarily equivalent but not identical
result = model.check_formula("((p \\wedge \\neg p) \\equiv (q \\wedge \\neg q))")
```

### Key Implementation Features

1. **Bitvector Representation**: States represented as Z3 bitvectors
2. **Efficient Fusion**: Bitwise OR for state combination
3. **Constraint Generation**: Automatic generation of semantic constraints
4. **Model Finding**: Z3 solver finds models satisfying all constraints

## Examples and Applications

### Example 1: Hyperintensional Distinctions

```python
# These are logically equivalent but hyperintensionally distinct
premises = ["p \\leftrightarrow q"]
conclusions = ["p \\equiv q"]  # Propositional identity
# This is invalid - logical equivalence doesn't ensure identity
```

### Example 2: Relevance Logic

```python
# Classical tautologies may fail when relevance is required
premises = []
conclusions = ["(p \\preceq (q \\rightarrow p))"]  # May be invalid
# p is not relevant to "q → p"
```

### Example 3: Counterfactual Reasoning

```python
# Fine's semantics for counterfactuals
premises = ["\\neg p", "p \\boxright q"]
conclusions = ["p \\boxright r"]  # Doesn't follow
# Different verifiers for p may lead to different alternatives
```

## Theoretical Background

The hyperintensional framework in ModelChecker builds on several key theoretical developments:

1. **Truthmaker Semantics**: Developed by Kit Fine, providing a framework where propositions are characterized by what makes them true/false rather than just their truth conditions

2. **Bilateral Propositions**: Unlike classical propositions that are sets of worlds, bilateral propositions have both verifier and falsifier states

3. **Non-Boolean Structure**: The space of hyperintensional propositions forms a non-interlaced bilattice rather than a Boolean algebra

4. **Subject-Matter Sensitivity**: The framework captures distinctions in subject-matter and content that classical logic overlooks
