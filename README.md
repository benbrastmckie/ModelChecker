# ModelChecker: Unified Programmatic Semantics Framework

[Code →](Code/README.md) | [Documentation →](Docs/README.md) | [Theory Library →](Code/src/model_checker/theory_lib/README.md)

## Overview

The **ModelChecker** provides a programmatic framework for developing and exploring modular semantic theories. Built on the SMT solver Z3, it enables researchers to establish logical consequence over finite models, automatically generating readable countermodels when formulas or inferences are invalid.

## Installation

### Basic Installation

```bash
pip install model-checker
```

### With Jupyter Support

```bash
pip install model-checker[jupyter]
```

For Jupyter notebook features and interactive exploration, see the [Jupyter Integration Guide](Code/src/model_checker/jupyter/README.md).

### Development Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/benbrastmckie/ModelChecker
cd ModelChecker/Code
# Use the development CLI to run locally without installation:
./dev_cli.py examples/my_example.py
```

For comprehensive development setup instructions, including virtual environments and platform-specific guidance, see the [Development Guide](Code/docs/DEVELOPMENT.md). NixOS users can use the provided `shell.nix` configuration for automatic environment setup.

### Installation Guides

For comprehensive installation instructions including platform-specific guides, virtual environments, and troubleshooting, see the [Installation Documentation](Docs/installation/README.md).

## Quick Start

### 1. Create a Project

```bash
# Create a copy of the logos semantics (default)
model-checker

# Or load a specific theory
model-checker -l logos        # Hyperintensional semantics with all subtheories
model-checker -l exclusion    # Unilateral exclusion semantics
model-checker -l imposition   # Fine's counterfactual semantics
model-checker -l bimodal      # Bimodal logic for tense and circumstantial modalities

# Load specific logos subtheories
model-checker -l logos --subtheory counterfactual  # Just counterfactual + dependencies
```

This creates a project directory with `examples.py`, `semantic.py`, `operators.py`, and supporting files.

### 2. Run Examples

```bash
# Run the examples file created in your project
model-checker examples.py

# Compare multiple theories
model-checker examples.py --maximize

# Save results in various formats
model-checker examples.py --save           # All formats
model-checker examples.py --save json      # JSON only
```

### 3. Next Steps

- **New to ModelChecker?** Follow the [Getting Started Guide](Docs/installation/GETTING_STARTED.md)
- **Ready to develop?** See [The ModelChecker Methodology](#the-modelchecker-methodology) below
- **Need examples?** Check the [Examples Guide](Docs/usage/EXAMPLES.md) and [example structure](Docs/installation/GETTING_STARTED.md#example-structure)

## The ModelChecker Methodology

The ModelChecker provides a systematic methodology for developing and studying semantic theories. This section provides an overview of the workflow - for the complete methodology guide, see [Docs/usage/WORKFLOW.md](Docs/usage/WORKFLOW.md).

### 1. Create Your Theory Project

Start by creating a new project or loading an existing theory:

```bash
# Create a copy of the logos semantics
model-checker                                        # Creates a logos semantics by default with all subtheories

# Load an existing theory as starting point
model-checker -l logos --subtheory counterfactual    # Just counterfactual + dependencies
model-checker -l exclusion                           # Unilateral exclusion semantics
model-checker -l imposition                          # Fine's counterfactual semantics
model-checker -l bimodal                             # Bimodal logic for tense and circumstantial modalities
```

This creates a complete project directory with `examples.py`, `semantic.py`, `operators.py`, and supporting files. See [Project Creation Guide](Docs/usage/PROJECT.md) for detailed instructions.

### 2. Develop Examples

Edit the `examples.py` file to test logical inferences relevant to your theory:

```bash
# Run your examples
model-checker examples.py
```

Define the logical questions your theory should answer and verify its behavior on key inferences. See the [Examples Guide](Docs/usage/EXAMPLES.md) and [Settings Guide](Docs/usage/SETTINGS.md) for details.

### 3. Adapt Semantic Framework

Modify `semantic.py` to implement your specific semantic theory. Add new constraints, modify existing ones, or create entirely new semantic frameworks to capture the logical principles that distinguish your theory. See the [Semantics Guide](Docs/usage/SEMANTICS.md).

### 4. Define Custom Operators

Extend your theory's expressive power with new operators:

- **Defined operators** in `operators.py` - shortcuts for combinations of existing operators
- **Primitive operators** requiring semantic interpretation in `semantic.py`

See the [Operators Guide](Docs/usage/OPERATORS.md) for implementation patterns.

### 5. Iterate Models and Compare Theories

Explore the space of models your theory allows and systematically compare with alternative approaches:

```bash
# Test single theory
model-checker examples.py

# Compare multiple theories
model-checker examples.py --maximize
```

See the [Tools Guide](Docs/usage/TOOLS.md) for model iteration and theory comparison.

### 6. Save and Export Results

Export your findings in formats suitable for analysis or publication:

```bash
model-checker examples.py --save           # All formats (json, markdown, jupyter)
model-checker examples.py --save json      # Machine-readable JSON
model-checker examples.py --save markdown  # Human-readable markdown
```

See the [Output Guide](Docs/usage/OUTPUT.md) for format options.

### Complete Methodology

This systematic approach enables you to:
1. **Start** with working theories as foundations
2. **Test** logical inferences computationally
3. **Customize** semantic behavior through constraints
4. **Extend** expressive power with new operators
5. **Explore** the space of possible models
6. **Compare** different theoretical approaches
7. **Document** and share your findings

For the complete step-by-step methodology with detailed examples and advanced techniques, see the [full Methodology Guide](Docs/usage/WORKFLOW.md).
